  Cargo Tracking System - Hash Table Based Application
  
This is a simple cargo tracking system written in C programming language. It uses a hash table to store and manage cargo data efficiently. The collision resolution method used is double hashing.


Features
  
* Add cargo (via user input or from veriler.txt)
* List all cargos
* Search cargo by tracking number
* Deliver and remove cargo from the system
* Fast access using hash table logic


Technologies Used
  
* C Language
* Hash Table
* Double Hashing
* Dynamic Memory Management (malloc, free)
* File I/O (fopen, fscanf, fprintf)


File Structure
  
* main.c – Contains the full source code
* veriler.txt – A plain text file used for data persistence. The program reads from and writes to this file.
